            <p>Page columns are a design element commonly used in print and digital layouts to organize text and improve
                readability. By dividing content into multiple vertical sections, columns help guide the reader's eye
                more naturally across the page. This layout mimics how newspapers and magazines present information,
                making it easier to scan through large amounts of text without feeling overwhelmed. Columns also allow
                for a more balanced distribution of text and white space, contributing to a cleaner, more professional
                appearance.</p>
            <p>In digital documents and web design, columns are used to structure content responsively, adapting to
                different screen sizes and devices. For example, a webpage might display three columns on a desktop
                screen but collapse them into a single column on a mobile device to maintain readability. Tools like CSS
                Flexbox and Grid make it easy to implement column layouts dynamically. In word processors or desktop
                publishing software, users can manually set the number and width of columns to suit their needs, whether
                they’re creating newsletters, brochures, or academic papers.</p>
            <p>Designing with columns also allows for better integration of visual elements like images, sidebars, and
                pull quotes. A multi-column layout gives designers flexibility to place these elements strategically,
                creating a more engaging and visually appealing page. However, it's important to balance column width
                and spacing—columns that are too narrow can make text feel cramped, while overly wide ones can tire the
                reader’s eyes. When used thoughtfully, page columns are a powerful tool for enhancing both the function
                and form of a document.</p>
