                <p>In the late 19th century, sheepdogs in Germany were on the decline due to industrialization. During this period, a man named Max Emil Friedrich von Stephanitz, a former cavalry officer who served at the Veterinary College in Berlin, enjoyed attending dog shows. At these dog shows, he noted the lack of uniformity of the German sheepdog breed. </p>
                <p>While attending one particular dog show, Stephanitz encountered a dog that he felt best represented what a German working dog should be in appearance, intelligence, temperament, and abilities. Stephanitz purchased that dog and used it to breed a new standardized line that he called the German Shepherd.</p>

                <h2 class="h2">Modern Uses of German Sheperds</h2>
                <p>German Shepherds in the modern day are valued as both a police dog and a family pet. The German Shepherd's intelligence and stamina make it a popular choice amongst police departments when looking for a canine officer. Families also appreciate their intelligence alongside their loyalty.</p>
