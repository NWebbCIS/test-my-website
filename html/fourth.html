            <h2>About My Shepherd</h2>
            <p>We adopted our German Shepherd from a local breeder in Shelton, Washington. This breeder bred AKC-registered German Shepherds specifically for their temperament to be family pets, not working dogs. </p>
            <p>Elric is a very calm, loyal companion who is happy to match the energy level of the household. His intelligence made him easy to house train, socialize, and he is a wonderful canine brother to our other canine and feline family members.</p>

            <h2>Interesting and Funny Quirks</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>If Elric does not receive his morning treats in his Kong toy, he will wait until we sit down with our morning coffee, then use his nose to lift your arm and spill your coffee while trying to take a drink.</li>
                <li>Unlike his larger canine brother, Elric is not intimidated by our cats and does not respect their authority.</li>
                <li>Elric is so loyal that he will limit his food and potty breaks, instead choosing to stay by the window to wait for his favorite family member to return home.</li>
