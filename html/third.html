            <h3>Getting Started</h3>
            <p>When deciding if a German Shepherd is the right addition for your family, it is important to know that they are a very intelligent and loyal breed. Due to this, they have a high trainability level but require more mental stimulation than the average dog breed. Also, due to their history as working dogs, German Shepherds also have a high energy level and require regular exercise. </p>

            <h3>Potty Training</h3>
            <p>When potty training a German Shepherd, it is important to be proactive instead of reactive. Paying attention to your puppy's potty cues, such as sniffing around, circling, and whining. Setting a routine for your puppy to go outside to go potty and offering positive reinforcement when they do is essential to successful potty training.</p>

            <h3>Leash Training</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Introduce your puppy to the collar or harness they will be wearing when going for a walk.</li>
                <li>While inside, teach your puppy a sound cue. When they look at you, reward their attention with a treat.</li>
                <li>While inside, after giving the sound cue, while your puppy is approaching you while wearing the leash or harness, back up a few paces. When they follow you, reward them with a treat.</li>
                <li>Walk your puppy outside where more distractions are present. If your puppy is about to be distracted, use the sound cue to regain their attention and reward that attention with a treat.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section id="section-four">
            <h3>Socialization</h3>
            <p>Early socialization is an important part of a puppy&apos;s education, especially for a larger, intelligent breed like a German Shepherd. Socialization helps prevent your puppy from growing up fearful and aggressive. </p>
            <p>Exposing your puppy to new sights, sounds, and smells in a calm environment while using positive reinforcement is a good first step to socializing your puppy. Next, start introducing your puppy to one or two new people at a time. Once your puppy grows comfortable around strangers in a calm setting, you can try to expand their comfort level by taking them out into public.</p>
