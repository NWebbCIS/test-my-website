I received one response to my post in the module 7 discussion board.

The response contained one piece of advice, that being "There definitely needs to be more content. A lot of stuff is under construction, but I'm sure what you'll eventually put on there will be interesting."

This piece of advice was very on point. My website up until that point was almost entirely empty.

The first page was very bare bones, containing only one image and a brief description of what the website will contain.

The second page only contained ipsum lorem that was structured as part of the column assignment.

Lastly, the third and fourth pages were completely empty with the exeption of an "Under Construction" title.


In response to this advice, I have partially fleshed out all four pages, mainly with all the major sections that each page will be discussing.

Over the course of the remaining time with this course, I will add relevent content to all sections on all pages, design all the sections with their own uniform backgrounds, add more images, and increase usability.
